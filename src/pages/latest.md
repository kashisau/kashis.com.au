  I’m currently living in Kathmandu, Nepal, where I’m applying my professional skills as an IT Officer in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PkwCu3s6ZEscTcNK8Kirtipur" title="See our office on Google Maps" target="blank" rel="noopener">Kirtipur Municipality</a> for 12 months, as part of the <a href="https://www.australianvolunteers.com" title="Visit the Australian Volunteers Program website to find out more" target="blank" rel="noopener">Australian Volunteers Program</a>.

  The goal during my 12-months here is to help bring transparency to government process through technology, and implement software that makes government services more widely accessible to the people of Kirtipur.
