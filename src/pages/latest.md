  I’m currently living in Kathmandu, Nepal, where I’m applying my professional skills as a IT Officer in Kirtipur Municipality for 12 months, as part of the Australian Volunteers Program.

  The duties involve finding ways to bring transparency to government process through technology, and implementing software that makes local government services more widely accessible to the people of Kirtipur and Nepal more broadly.
  
  Find out more about this adventure on my co-authored blog, _The Unlikely Sherpas_.
