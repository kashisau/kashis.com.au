  Now back home from my 1 year placement with the Australian Volunteers Program, living and working as an IT Officer in Kirtipur Municipality, Kathmandu, I've taken a role at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

  We're in the process of implementing the tools that the organisation will use to maximise the engagement of our digital audiencesâ€”finding ways to promote the relevance of high-quality content that keeps millions of Australians informed and entertained each day.

  Between ABC and and the B.Arts (Philosophy & Linguistics) I'm studying part-time, I'm being kept plenty busy, and therefore will not be available for freelance work in the foreseeable future.
