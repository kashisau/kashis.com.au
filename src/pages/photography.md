  My interest in photography flourished with my love for travel.

  As I've further enjoyed the privilege of seeing more of the world, I've adopted the task of sharing the culture and landscapes I've been privy to, learning more of the art and science of photography as I go along.
  
  I publish a selection of photos on my alternate Instagram account, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kashis.photo/" title="See my photos on Instagram">@kashis.photo</a> or on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/kashisau/" title="See my photos on Flickr">Flickr</a>.
