  My interest in photography flourished over the years together with my love for exploration and nature.

  As I've further enjoyed the privilege of seeing the world, I've adopted the task of sharing the culture and landscapes I've been privy to, leaning more on the art and science of photography as I go along.
  
  I publish a selection of photos on my alternate Instagram account, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kashis.photo/" title="See my photos on Instagram" target="blank" rel="noopener">@kashis.photo</a> or on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/kashisau/" title="See my photos on Flickr" target="blank" rel="noopener">Flickr</a>.
