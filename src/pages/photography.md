  My interest in photography flourished along with my love of nature and exploration. And as I've ventured further into both, I've taken up the task of documenting the culture and landscapes that I've been witness to, learning more of the art and science of photography as I go along.
  
  I publish a selection of photos on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/kashisau/" title="See my photos on Flickr" target="blank" rel="noopener">Flickr</a>, and on my alternate Instagram account, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kashis.photo/" title="See my photos on Instagram" target="blank" rel="noopener">@kashis.photo</a>.
