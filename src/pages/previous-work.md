  ## Bears
  As a full-stack developer within the Enterprise & Digital Services team in the Special Broadcasting Service, I rebuilt The Feed website using a combination of t3js and SASS, fetching data from an eventual consistency document caching system engineered by our team to decouple our legacy Drupal CMSs from their resentation layer using Symfony.
  ## Chairs
  This project also allowed me to guide the implementation of a data layer in a bid to modernise our analytics approach across The Feed, SBS News and other SBS properties.
