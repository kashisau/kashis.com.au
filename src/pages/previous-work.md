  As a full-stack developer within the Enterprise & Digital Services team in the Special Broadcasting Service, I rebuilt The Feed website using a combination of t3js and SASS, fetching data from an eventual consistency document caching system engineered by our team to decouple our legacy Drupal CMSs from their resentation layer using Symfony. This project also allowed me to guide the implementation of a data layer in a bid to modernise our analytics approach across The Feed, SBS News and other SBS properties.
